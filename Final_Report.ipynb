    "#### Background Information\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite nationwide crime rates declining since the 1990s in Canada (STATCAN 2021), many Canadians still fear crime, especially in their local communities (JUSTICE CANADA, 2022). Current research suggests that effective crime control strategies embrace the importance of regular citizens in preventing crime and enhance their ability to do so (USCIDA et al., 2014). This research focuses on empowering citizens by providing an understanding of overall and crime-specific proportions across the communities of Vancouver. This analysis will infer which districts in Vancouver have proportionally higher and lower crime rates.\n",

    "To answer this question, we will explore the proportion of crimes grouped per year from **2003** to **2021** and across the **Central**, **East**, **South** and **West** districts of Vancouver. We will calculate the mean proportion of crime that lies in each district annually and find the interquartile range. We will also analyze trends for different crime types to explore significant pattern changes."
